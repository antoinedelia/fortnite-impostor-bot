# Fortnite Impostor's bot

Python script to automate your Fortnite Imposter's games.

## Prerequisites

- Languages
    - You **SHOULD** have the language set in english, so that it can match the images in the folder.
    - You **CAN** have whatever language you want, but then, you **MUST** replace the images from the folder with new ones that you have.
- Variables
    - By default, the emote button is set to 'B' in Impostorr's mode. But if you have set it to something else, make sure to change it in the `main.py` file.
    This will allow you to emote in-game, preventing the new AFK penalty.

## Getting Started

```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python main.py
```

### Optional

Install [Tesseract](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) and add it to your `PATH` environment varibales to know how much XP you won (each game and in total).
